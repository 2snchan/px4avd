Simple Obstacle Avoidance System Using RPLidar A2 and Pixhawk, ROS  
Created By 이승찬, Korea Science Academy of KAIST 19th.  
Developed Since 2020.10 ~  

# Requirements
**Drone**  
**FC** : Holybro Pixhawk 4 (FMUv4)  
Just Recommended. Other FC can connected with Linux device with MAVLink can be used.  
**FrameWheel** : DJI F450, 2212 920kv, 4cell Lipo  
Just Recommended, But 450-sized frame is best.  
(Because bigger frame doesn't match purpose for obstacle avoidance, and smaller frame cannot carry Linux device and other modules.)  
**RC** : I used FrSky Taranis Q7 - x8R  
**Avoidance System**  
**Linux Device** : Raspberry Pi 3B+ or higher. If you want to use lower spec device, you can experience frequent freezing when setting up the environment.
